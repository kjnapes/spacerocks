A list of features we want to implement after the initial release.

### N-Body
- Symplectic Integrator
- Hybrid Symplectic Integrator
- Simulation dashboard
- Extra forces for simulations
    - Full GR Treatment
    - Galactic Tides
    - Earth harmonics J2, J4, J6
    - Solar Radiation Pressure
    - YORP?
    - Poynting-Robertson Drag
    - Outgassing support for individual bodies

### Orbit Fitting
- Full numerical orbit fitter
- More initial orbit determination methods
    - 4D Napier & Holman (2025) solution
    - 2-observation 
    - 2-streak fit

### Data Tools
- Minor Planet Checker 

### SPICE
- Custom spice file handling (to remove the dependency on cspice)
